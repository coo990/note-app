# Note App - Chuka, Ashley, Fabio
## Our Approach
* Started with the model to make sure that the text added is reduced by 20 characters, with the testing to prove it works.
* Along with the ability to contain an entire note within the same page.
* Web app is written as a one-page to store notes in local storage. With the 'Clear All' button used in the DOM element to initate clearing of post.
